 The input_data.csv file is your sample dataset used for:

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev, etc.)

Correlation analysis

Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square)

Histogram and frequency distribution

Letâ€™s create a clean, multipurpose CSV file that demonstrates all core features of your CLI calculator.

Column Descriptions
Column	Type	Use
StudentID	String	Identifier (not used in calculations)
MathScore	Numeric	For descriptive stats, correlation, t-tests
EnglishScore	Numeric	For correlation and t-tests
Gender	Categorical	For chi-square tests (e.g., count of M/F)

This CSV Supports:
Feature	How
Mean, Median, Mode	From MathScore or EnglishScore
Skewness, Kurtosis	On any numeric column
Correlation	Between MathScore and EnglishScore
